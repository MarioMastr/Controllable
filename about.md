This mod simply aims to improve the GD controller experience, while keeping
compatibile with every mod on the index, out of the box! This mod adds:
- A proper button selection system, letting you to use a joystick or d-pad
- Proper shoulder button scrolling support through paginated screens
- Proper right joystick scrolling through scrollable lists
- Proper text input support, (as well as general text input bugfixes)
- Extended support for Custom Keybinds
- Fixes for broken slider textures
- Extra support for modded UI for maximum ease-of-use!

This mod also has settings, to allow you to customise every aspect of the mod,
such as deadzones, outline colour and whether to use a fixed outline, a fancy
pants shader outline or a hover outline!

This mod is still extremely new, and as such still has minor bugs, mostly to do
with checkboxes and buttons that change state when pressed. Android and Mac 
support is functional, but still in the works!
