# Controllable

This mod simply aims to improve the GD controller experience, while keeping
compatibile with every mod on the index, out of the box! This mod adds:
- A proper button selection system, allowing you to use a joystick or d-pad
- Proper shoulder button scrolling support through paginated screens such as the
main level list
- Proper right joystick scrolling through scrollable lists, including modded
scrollable layers
- Proper text input support, as well as general text input bugfixes, allowing
you to deselect vanilla text inputs like modded text inputs, though this mod
does not include an on-screen keyboard
- Extended support for Custom Keybinds, while leaving it optional if you do not
have it installed
- Extra support for modded UI for maximum ease-of-use!

This mod also has settings, to allow you to customise every aspect of the mod,
such as deadzones, outline colour and whether to use a fixed outline, a fancy
pants shader outline or a hover outline!

This mod is still extremely new, and as such still has small bugs, mostly to do
with checkboxes and buttons that change state when pressed. If you find any
issues with the mod, please report them to the GitHub repository.
Post-release plans are to fix togglers (checkboxes and buttons with two states),
and to add Android and MacOS support!
